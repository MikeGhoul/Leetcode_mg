-- Left Join:
-- A left join returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. 
-- If there's no match, the result is NULL on the right side.

-- Use cases:
-- Retrieving all data from a primary table with optional related data.
-- Finding records in one table that don't have a corresponding match in another.
-- Combining data from multiple tables where a relationship may not always exist.
