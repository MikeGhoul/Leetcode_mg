SQL QUESTION 5: What is database denormalization?

Denormalization is the process of modifying a database schema in a way that deviates from the typical rules of normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.).

Denormalization is often used to improve the performance of a database, particularly when it is being used for reporting and analytical purposes (rather than in an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) manager).

By duplicating data, denormalization can reduce the number of expensive joins required to retrieve data, which can improve query performance.
However, denormalization can also cause problems such as increased data redundancy and the need for more complex update and delete operations.


# From chatgpt:

Database denormalization is the process of intentionally adding redundancy to one or more tables in a relational database. It involves structuring a database in such a way that it reduces the need for joins and improves query performance at the expense of increased storage space and potential data inconsistency.

Normalization, on the other hand, is the process of organizing the data in a database efficiently. It aims to minimize redundancy and dependency by dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them. 
This helps ensure data integrity and reduces the risk of anomalies such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies.

Denormalization can be applied in scenarios where performance is critical, such as in data warehousing or reporting systems, where complex queries are frequent and need to be executed quickly. By duplicating data and avoiding joins, denormalization can speed up query execution time.

However, denormalization also introduces the risk of data inconsistency because redundant data may become out of sync if not properly maintained. 
Therefore, its important to weigh the trade-offs between performance optimization and data integrity when considering denormalization in a database design.
